Party at Morrie’s Place: 

Imagine yourself at a birthday party where N
people are invited. Every two people are either friends to each other or
strangers to each other. The friends have a connection between each other
which is represented by an edge.


● N = 6
● Connection/ Edge =[ [1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [4, 5], [6, 3], [4, 6], [5, 6] ]


Problem:

1. Represent the adjacenency matrix for the graph 

2. We want to determine some information from this party graph:
a. First, finding friends for each person.
b. Whether there is a formation of friendship cycles? If yes, can you find such a number of cycles?
